## description
In building up my profile as a developer, I attempted this project to practice the javascript skills I got introduced to in the past week.

The user uses a slider to set random password length to determine length that is preset between  8 and 128 characters picked randomly from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

A key aspect of Javascript that stuck with me here is the iteration and the practice of creating    and calling functions.

Seeing how to use a combination of the Math.random and the Math.floor function was deeply satisfying

## Credits
My most profound gratitude goes to Andrew Kemp for helping look through a problematic aspect of the code.

I need to also gice credit to my class Instructor Jon Lynch and Cody

I believe it is the further step to a wider world of possibilities in Software development
